Description 
A simple eCommerce web application that demonstrates key shopping functionalities using a fake API. Users can browse products by category, filter by price (high-to-low, low-to-high), add items to a cart, and create new products that are displayed alongside existing ones. Created products and cart data are stored in localStorage for persistence. Includes basic login and logout functionality to simulate user sessions.
